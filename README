merb_ajax
=================

A plugin for the Merb framework that provides Rails-like helper methods for Ajax (prototype, scriptaculous).

To use this plugin in merb in your app

config/dependencies.rb

#...

dependency "merb_ajax"

#...

Please refer to the RDoc for the helper methods available. Functionality should be very similar to the corresponding
Rails methods since they have been taken straight from the rails gems and then modified.

Please note that the current version has been quickly assembled and not yet sufficiently tested. It seems to work with
my current merb project, though ;-)

Email me at ulf@projecttray.com if you've got any comments, suggestions or questions.
